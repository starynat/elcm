<h3>I'm gonna get a little cheesyness but I just wanted to thank you for making one of the toughest years so far more tolerable.I seriously am so grateful to have had a super cool and popular older brother guiding me through so many new experiences this year. Wether it's getting revenge on very ugly people we once had a crush on or grabbing lunch, I would say this year you are one of the most positively influential people in my life, so thank you for caring and taking the time to truly getting to know my sister and I. I was so happy that I got you for secret santa because I knew exactly what I wanted to do for you. I decided you need somewhere to link your super cool photography on your insta for everyone to see!! I do need you to help me with it a bit though in choosing the main images you like and what sections so I just thought I would pitch the idea to you now. Merry Christams Love, NAT! </h3>
